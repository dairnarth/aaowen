In an attempt to learn latex, I've typeset (badly, but typeset nonetheless) some articles written by composer, pianist and teacher, Albert Alan Owen.
The originals can be found at [aaowen.com](http://aaowen.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=4&Itemid=29).

A few passes of aaowen.tex through ``pdflatex`` ought to do the trick.
